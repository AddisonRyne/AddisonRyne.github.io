## About me
I’m Addison, a Marine Science B.S. candidate studying how ecological processes shape marine communities. My work spans black abalone habitat surveys, phytoplankton imaging/analysis, and shipboard sampling. I analyze data in R, MATLAB, and ArcGIS, and I love translating field observations into clear visuals and stories. I’m exploring research/field tech roles for Jan 2026 and planning a Ph.D. focused on intertidal ecology and community changes.
